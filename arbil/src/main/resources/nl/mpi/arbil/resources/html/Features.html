        <b>The following features are functional</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Fields can be copied from a table containing a single IMDI file and then pasted into the selected rows of any table (only matching field names will be pasted).</li>
            <li>The data copied from a table can be edited in an external editor and then pasted back into a table provided that it remains in the correct format.</li>
            <li>IMDI Session nodes or sub node of a Session can be flagged as a template. These templates then can be used to add new nodes via the "Add From Template" menu.</li>
            <li>Searching sub nodes for both text and node types (corpus, actors, sessions, etc.) using multiple 'and', 'or', 'not' boolean parameters</li>
            <li>Creating an off line cache of a corpus (downloading from a server)</li>
            <li>Creation of Corpus nodes</li>
            <li>Creation of Session nodes</li>
            <li>Editing of values in a Corpus node</li>
            <li>Editing of values in a Session node</li>

            <li>Saving views and setting the default view</li>
            <li>Preview of jpeg files (other media in progress)</li>

            <li>Enabled the file save menu</li>
            <li>Added check before closing for unsaved changes</li>
            <li>When a node has been edited and not save to disk it will have a red exclamation mark in front of its icon</li>

        <ul>
            <li>local repository of actors "project"-info etc. that can be quickly added to a new session is not yet implemented</li>
            <li>Menus need to be generalised so that all functions available in relevant contexts.</li>
            <li>Edit menu needs to be populated with the generalised menu</li>
            <li>Templates functionality needs to be completed and enabled</li>

            <li>The default order of columns in a table needs to be set from the imdi file format</li>
            
            <li>The integration with Lamus has not yet begun so it is recommended to limit work to new corpus trees. Rather than editing files that already exist in a Corpus on the server</li>
            <li>The function to export for use in Lamus is not yet present </li>
            <!--<li>Resource images are not displayed when the application opens and remembers the previous windows.</li>-->
            <li>Sections of a session that have multiple elements are not formatted consistently</li>
            <!--            <li>Resource files cannot yet be added to a session</li>-->
            <li>Preview of media files will only display jpg files at this stage</li>
            <li>Webstart occasionally gives an error that it can't find jar files when the internet connection is slow</li>
            <!--            <li>Save changes on exit and from file menu needs to be added</li>-->
<!--            <li>Adding a node reloads sibling nodes without saving any changes</li>-->

<!--            <li>Search has been disabled because it will be revamped in the near future</li>-->
<!--            <li>Table column width is not always set correctly</li>-->
            <li>The right click menu is about to be updated which will populate the edit menu and add copy paste functions where applicable</li>
            <li>Copy / paste of existing node elements is not yet implemented</li>
            <li>Undo / redo functionality is not yet available</li>
            <li>A number of mouse actions currently cannot be done on multiple selections</li>
            <li>Hide / show hidden files in the working directory</li>
            <!--            <li>When adding or remove local directory and few other situations, the tree branches will close</li>-->
<!--            <li>When adding nodes the new nodes will not always be displayed immediately</li>-->
            <li>On Mac the internal windows can be slow when dragged around</li>
            <li>The versions of a imdi file cannot yet be viewed</li>
            <li>In the resource preview window the row selection of the table is not yet synchronised with the preview items</li>

            <li>Keyboard short cuts for add session etc. has not yet been added</li>
            <li>Controlled vocabularies displayed in the table cell are dependant on the information in the imdi file and needs to be made more robust</li>
            <li>There are some cosmetic display issues on Mac</li>
            <!--            <li>When a node is saved or reloaded the colour indicating the need to save may not update immediately</li>-->
            <li>Currently it is not possible to add or drag to sub nodes of a session, this must for now be done only on the session node</li>
            <li>Currently it is not possible delete sub nodes of a session, ie actors and resources</li>
