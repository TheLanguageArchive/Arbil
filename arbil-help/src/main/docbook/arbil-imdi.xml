    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Arbil is an application for arranging research material and associated metadata into a
      format appropriate for archiving. </para>
    <para>Arbil is designed so that it can be used off-line in a remote location. The data can be
      entered at any stage in part or as a whole. When an internet connection is available the work
      can then be transferred to the main archive via Lamus.</para>
    <section id="Sec_General_Information">
      <title>General Information</title>
      <para>Two steps are required in adding a corpus to the MPI Archive. The first involves
        creating the corpus, editing the metadata and converting it into an archivable format using
          <emphasis role="bold">ARBIL</emphasis>(Archive Builder) while the second involves
        exporting the created/edited corpus to the archive using <emphasis role="bold"
          >LAMUS</emphasis> .</para>
      <para>This manual describes in detail the first step, i.e. <emphasis role="bold"
          >Arbil</emphasis>. For the second step, <emphasis role="bold">Lamus</emphasis>, please
        refer to the <ulink url="http://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/lamus">LAMUS manual</ulink>). </para>
      <para>Arbil allows you to view all the corpora in the archive or any other remote location
        (provided you have access rights).</para>
      <para>Corpora from the archive can also be edited through Arbil. If the changes are to be
        implemented they have to go through <emphasis role="bold">Lamus</emphasis>.</para>
      <para> In short, Arbil allows you to: </para>
      <para>1) view the archive;</para>
      <para>2) import metadata from the archive and edit them;</para>
      <para>3) create new corpora, with new metadata and media files;</para>
      <para>4) export the IMDI files, which are then ready to be archived.</para>
      <para>Changes you make to corpora imported from the archive will <emphasis role="underline"
            ><emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis></emphasis> affect the archive directly, as Arbil
        merely allows you to make changes on a <emphasis role="bold">local level</emphasis>, and not
        to the archive itself. If you want to upload your changes to the archive, you must export
        them to LAMUS, which in turn, allows you to submit corpora into the archive.</para>
      <para>Arbil is the next generation of the <emphasis role="bold">IMDI</emphasis> Editor with a
        more powerful user interface and functionality. This manual contains detailed information on
        how to use Arbil: how to create new corpus structures/session nodes, and how to modify
        existing corpora. It does not explain the internal structure of IMDI, though. For more
        information on the IMDI metadata set, please refer to the following link: <ulink

      <para>You can access all the information present in this manual from the application itself,
        using the Help Menu. </para>
      <para>We encourage you to provide feedback, comments, and suggestions, so that we can improve

    <section id="Sec_Overview">
      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>The way you start working on your data is twofold. You can:</para>
      <para>a) either create a new corpus;  </para>
      <para>b) or make a copy of an already existing corpus or of its branch from the server and
        edit it.</para>
      <para>Either way, the files you create/edit will be saved on your computer (in the so called
          <emphasis role="bold">Local Corpus</emphasis>). This enables you to work off-line in a
        remote location while still in the field. Changes you make in Arbil will <emphasis
          role="underline"><emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis></emphasis> affect the
        archive.</para>
      <para>Arbil consists of 6 working areas as shown in the figure below:</para>
      <para>1) the <emphasis role="bold">Menu Bar</emphasis>, which allows you to access the main
        commands;</para>
      <para>2) the <link linkend="Sec_Remote_Corpus"><emphasis role="bold">Remote
          Corpus</emphasis></link>, which contains locations from the Language Archive. Here is
        where you can see the corpora and choose the ones you wish to import;</para>
      <para>3) the <link linkend="Sec_Local_Corpus"><emphasis role="bold">Local
          Corpus</emphasis></link>, which contains the user's main working area. Here is where
        corpora from the Remote Corpus can be imported and edited. It is also used for creating new
        corpora;</para>
      <para>4) the <link linkend="Sec_Working_Directories"><emphasis role="bold">Files /Favourites
            (Working Directories)</emphasis></link>. Here is where you can link directories from
        your computer to Arbil in order to import media files and create favourite metadata items.
        It is useful for quickly accessing frequently used item;</para>
      <para>5) the <emphasis role="bold">Preview Area</emphasis>, which shows metadata of the
        selected node (in the figure below, it displays the details for "New Corpus"). It changes
        every time a new node is selected;</para>
      <para>6) the <emphasis role="bold">Table Area</emphasis>, which is where several nodes can be
        opened, compared, and modified at the same time (in the figure below, the three nodes from
        the Local Corpus are placed in a table in this area).</para>
      <para>
        <note>
          <para>You can customize the size of these panels. To make a window larger or smaller place
            the pointer on the border and drag it in the direction in which you want the window to
            expand or contract. It is also possible to hide the preview area by unchecking the
            option <emphasis role="bold">Show Selection Preview</emphasis> from the <emphasis

      <title>Workflow</title>
      <para>When working with Arbil, you have to decide whether you are going to <link
          linkend="Sec_Remote_Corpus" role="bold">work on an existing corpus from the Remote
          Corpus</link> or <link linkend="Sec_New_Corpora" role="bold">create a new corpus</link>.
        Assuming that you intend to edit metadata in the archive and add additional media files, you
        will have to follow the steps 1-6 below. </para>
      <para>The Arbil workflow for editing a corpus is as follows:</para>
      <para>1) Browse the Remote Corpus and select the corpus which you intend to edit; drag it from
        the Remote Corpus panel into the Local Corpus panel so as to import it. </para>
      <para>2) Now that the corpus is located in the Local Corpus, you may edit it freely. To edit
        the metadata, drag the node into the Table Area (marked with number 6 in figure 1.1 ) and
        edit the fields accordingly (editing can also be done in an external editor). This can be
        done with several corpora/sessions at once.</para>
      <para>3) In order to add resources to sessions (e.g. media files and annotations), you must
          <link linkend="Sec_Working_Directories">set up a working directory</link> which links a
        folder on your computer to Arbil. This means that any media files in this folder will appear
        in the Working directory area so that <link linkend="Sec_Adding_Resource_Files" role="bold"
          >resource files can be added</link> to the sessions of a corpus in your Local Corpus. To
        add files to your new corpus, drag and drop them from the tab <emphasis role="bold"
          >Files</emphasis> to the <emphasis role="bold">Local Corpus</emphasis>. Now you can edit
        the metadata following step 2 above.</para>
      <para>4) Stored session elements, such as common actors, can be added to the local corpus via
        the right click option<emphasis role="bold">Add from favorites</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>5) Once your metadata have been edited correctly and your desired media files have been
        added to your sessions, you can export the metadata files to a directory (folder) on your
        computer.</para>
      <para>In order to create a new node, add a node in the Local Corpus and follow the same
        steps.</para>
      <para>Note: This is as far as you can get using Arbil. </para>
      <para>6) Once the work is finished, Open <ulink url="http://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/lamus"
          >Lamus</ulink> and import the directory (folder) which contains the corpora. It is crucial
        to note that instead of uploading single files you can make use of the potential of Arbil
        and upload entire directories including all linkages among the individual files contained.
        Via Lamus, your work can then be <link lang="" linkend="Sec_Favourites">uploaded to the
          archive</link>.</para>
      <para>Corpus and session nodes are easily edited directly in Arbil (see <link
          linkend="Ch_Editing_Corpus_Structure">chapter 4</link> and <link
          linkend="Ch_Editing_Metadata">chapter 5</link>) but they can also be worked on in an <link
          linkend="Sec_Favourites">external editor</link>, such as Microsoft Excel or another
        spreadsheet program (see <link linkend="Sec_using_an_external_editor">7.3</link>). </para>

      <para>In Arbil all work on corpora and sessions takes place in the Local Corpus tree. The
        various import, export, and edit operations, displayed in the figure above, can usually be
        triggered by right-clicking on elements in the Local Corpus, or via "drag and drop" (e.g..
        clicking on an element in the Remote Corpus, holding the mouse key and dragging the element
        to the Local Corpus, or to a corpus node within the Local Corpus). Media files (i. e. audio
        and video recordings) and written resources can also be added to sessions via "drag and
        drop" from the Working Directories tree in the Files tab. Only for importing previously
        exported sessions to the local corpus root one has to access the File menu in Arbil's menu
        bar. </para>

    <title>Starting Arbil</title>
    <para>When you open Arbil for the first time the <emphasis role="italic">wizard</emphasis> will
      appear and give you the possibility to configure Arbil to your needs. The first window is a
      welcome window. Press <emphasis role="bold">Next</emphasis> to move to the second step of the
      wizard. In this window, you select the metadata format i.e. IMDI or CMDI; you can choose one
      or both of them. In this manual we will assume that IMDI is used but the instructions apply
      equivalently to CMDI . The third window enables you to choose the corpora that will appear in
      the <emphasis role="bold">Remote Corpus</emphasis> box. If you know the URL<footnote
        id="fn_url">
        <para>You can copy the URL of a corpus by selecting the node in the remote tree in Arbil
          when the wizard is not showing, right click and select 'Copy'; or get it from the IMDI
          browser by navigating to the corpus, right click the node and select 'Create bookmark' and
          copy the URL link. Then you can paste it into the box in the wizard.</para>
      </footnote> of a corpus that you will be working on frequently, you can add it to this list so
      that it will be available on the root level of the tree in the Remote corpus box. After
      finishing with <emphasis role="bold">Remote locations</emphasis> press <emphasis role="bold"
        >Next</emphasis> and then the <emphasis role="bold">Finish</emphasis> button. You can reopen
      the wizard through the <emphasis role="bold">Help</emphasis> menu by choosing <emphasis

      <para>The tab <emphasis role="bold">Favourites</emphasis> is meant for storing session
        elements that you would like to re-use in new sessions, such as <emphasis role="italic"
          >actors, language elements, locations</emphasis> etc. Elements that can be saved in
        Favourites are: IMDI sessions (<inlinegraphic fileref="images/session_icon.png"/>), actors,
        content elements, etc. When taken to the favorites tab, such elements are placed in their
        corresponding subcategories; i.e. if you drag an actor, this will be automatically located
        under the category "Actor". If you have a number of elements in your Favourite List and you
        are not certain what the content of a given element is, you can always place the cursor over
        it and wait for the tool tip (information window) to appear (see figure below). </para>

      <para>When viewing/editing multiple elements in a table, sometimes there are many columns to
        go through. It is possible to reduce them by choosing which columns you want to see or which
        columns you want to hide. Right click the header of any column, i.e. Name, and select the
        option <emphasis role="bold">Edit this Column View</emphasis>. In the window that pops up,
        you can select the columns that you want to show <emphasis role="bold">Show Only</emphasis>
        or hide <emphasis role="bold">Hide</emphasis> (if you check only the Hide column, the
        unchecked field names will be shown in the table). It is important to know that the
        column(s) which are hidden through this particular window, are not removed from the corpus
        itself.</para>

      <para>So let's say that you have <emphasis role="italic">Date</emphasis> and <emphasis

          only</emphasis> (see figure below). This means that if you would now use this window to
        check out a node that has other categories than the ones selected with the option <emphasis
          role="italic">Show only</emphasis>, then these categories will not be displayed. So the

      <para>If you have a table with: Name, Title and Description and you set the Description to
        Hide, it means that Description will never be shown. But if the elements that you add to the

      <para>One more option of customizing the column view is the function <emphasis role="bold"
          >Limit View to Current Columns</emphasis>, which you will find by right clicking the

        will be shown. </para>

      <para>The search option allows you to find a value throughout either the Local Corpus or the
        Remote Corpus (see section 6.2 below). To do so, right click on a given node you want to
        search and select <emphasis role="bold">Search</emphasis> (you might also choose a number of
        nodes by holding Ctrl and clicking on them). A window will appear in which you can specify
        where and what exactly you want to search e.g. within Corpus, Session, Catalogue, Actor
        etc.</para>

      <para>In the search window you can further specify in which column you want to search. By
        clicking on <emphasis role="bold">&lt;column (optional)></emphasis> a drop down list
        appears, containing pre-defined common values and previously entered column names; it is
        also possible to manually add column names to this list, or to remove arbitrary items by
        selecting the value and pressing the <emphasis role="bold">delete</emphasis> key on your
        keyboard; deleted values have to be retyped and searched for in order to appear in the drop
        down list again. After specifying the column (e.g. Name), give the value name you look for,
        e.g. "Blance", and click on <emphasis role="bold">search</emphasis>.</para>

        you will need to specify whether your search results should match the word you filled in or

      <title>Searching Remote Corpus</title>
      <para>In the first row of the remote search it is necessary to specify what you are looking
        for in the remote corpus so that the search will be narrowed down within the remote corpus
        (see figure 6.2 below). The results based on the first row provide all the nodes from all
        the sessions with this term (green box below). These results can be reduced by specifying
        more values in the second search row (red box below). After specifying values in the second
        line, searching in the remote corpus is similar to searching in the local corpus.</para>

      <title>Importing data into Arbil</title>
      <para>In Arbil there is a number of possibilities to import the data. </para>
      <para>The first way to import data is from the Remote corpus to the Local corpus, either by
        right clicking on the required branch in the remote corpus and selecting <emphasis
          role="bold">Import to Local Corpus</emphasis>, or by dragging and dropping it. </para>
      <para>If you want to import data from you local computer disk, or from the network, go to
          <emphasis role="bold">File</emphasis> menu, select <emphasis role="bold"
        >Import</emphasis>, and then choose the required data from your local disk, or from the
        network; your data wil be imported at the root level. </para>
      <para>In addition, at Local Corpus level, the context menu that comes out when right clicking
        one of the nodes includes further import options:</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Import Branch</emphasis> (i.e. importing a piece of your corpus)
        gives you the ability to import part of your corpus from your disk to the Local corpus. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Reimport this branch</emphasis> (i.e. re-importing form the remote
        corpus): in order to make changes to a corpus you have already exported to the Remote corpus
        via Lamus, it is essential to reimport such corpus to the Local corpus and choose Yes to the
        message question "Overwrite?".  </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Import CSV</emphasis> (i.e. in the table format) gives you the
        ability to import edited data in the Local corpus in the form of a table (for details see
        section <link linkend="Sec_using_an_external_editor">7.3</link> below).</para>

        them back to Arbil. </para>
      <para>However, possibilities of moving data back into Arbil are currently very <emphasis role="italic"

            selecting <emphasis role="bold">Import CSV</emphasis>. This way you will be able to
            import the data in a table format; in any other case you will have to import the edited data

        storage directory (to find out what that is, select Local Corpus Storage Directory from the
        Options menu). It will then automatically be installed in the type checker as soon as type
        checking takes place for the first time during a session. You will need to restart Arbil if
        it is already running.</para>      
      <para>For information about obtaining or creating a custom filetypes configuration, please contact your administrator.</para>

      <title>Templates</title>
      <para>Templates are currently in development, but they will be used to customise the components added via the "Add" menu.</para>
      <para>To create a new template, create a directory in the ".arbil/templates" directory. This is where all the files relevant to that template will be stored. This directory will now be selectable via the "options/templates" menu.</para>
      <para>Each template can have its own XSL which is used via the "view formatted" menu. The XSL must be in the selected templates directory and be called "format.xsl". For example: .arbil/templates/{template name}/format.xsl. If there are any additional files required by the XSL they can be placed in the same directory as the XSL file.</para>

      <title>New languages </title>
      <para>More languages can be added to the MPI-Languages CV upon request. Send an e-mail to
        corpus.manager@mpi.nl with the name and the ISO 639-3 code of the language you want to
        add.</para>

      <title>Plugins</title>
      <para>Plugins add extra functionality to Arbil. They are provided as '.jar' files that can be
        placed in a special location where Arbil will detect them and add them as items to the
        'Plugins' menu (which is hidden unless plugins have actually been detected).</para>
      <para>To install a plugin, place the .jar file in one of the following directories: </para>
      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>~/ArchivingPlugins (Linux or MacOS)</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>If none of the locations already exist, you can create one. Some options will not be
        available on all operating systems. ~ denotes the user's home directory on Unix systems.
        %APPDATA% and %USERPROFILE% are system environments available in Windows. Use the 'run
        command' option (Windows key + R) to open locations that contain the environment
        variable.</para>
      <para>&lt;ARBIL STORAGE DIRECTORY> is the directory called .arbil that contains the
        configuration files and by default is the parent directory of the working files
        directory.</para>
      <para>After installing the plugin you should restart Arbil for it to
        become available in the Plugins menu of the menu bar.</para>

      <title>Custom logging configuration</title>
      <para>If present, a logging configuration will be read and applied from a file called 
        'logging.properties' in the application configuration directory ('.arbil'). An
      example of such a configuration is given below.</para>
      <para>The logging output (visible in the log console of the Help menu) can be observed from
        different levels of detail. Such levels are: <emphasis role="bold">ALL</emphasis>, <emphasis
          role="bold">FINE</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">INFO</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"
          >WARNING</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">SEVERE</emphasis>. Note that the log console is
        visible only when the application is installed, i.e. NOT with the webstart version.  </para>
